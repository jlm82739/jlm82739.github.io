	<P>One of the most common arguments about modern technology is whether an iPhone or Android is a better device. In the end, it really comes down to personal preference. However, there are some key differences between the two that are vital to your decision.
	</P>
	<P>One critical feature is the battery life of the device. In the past, iPhones were notorious for having a short battery life, especially after extensive use. The current iPhones are a vast improvement over iPhones of the past, however Android offers such a variety of devices that the battery life of some of their phones massively exceeds that of any iPhone. According to <A href="https://newatlas.com/iphone-x-samsung-galaxy-s8-specs-comparison/51345/">newatlas.com</A>, <q>Apple's devices go toe-to-toe with the competition, thanks to an operating system that's been optimized for efficiency.</q></P>
	<P>Another important feature to compare is the interface. While iPhones are based more on simplicity and being user-friendly, Androids offer a very wide range of capabilities. Because of this, those who are more tech-savvy tend to prefer Androids because they are not as limiting. The video and table below highlight some more key differences in specs and operating system capabilities.
